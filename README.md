# Input compound generation
Predict pollution generation of industries and WWTP at CIC (Conques Internes de Catalunya). Use branca 'joan' (most updated one). The code to use is located under 'inputs compund generator'.

The main files are:
- pymain.py: interface for visualizing the results of the discarged pollutants from wwtp and industrial sites, and for uploading the results in a .sqlite generated by SWAT+
- pymain.py: directly upload the results of the discarged pollutants from wwtp and industrial sites in a TxtInOut folder generated by SWAT+ (to be used for calibrating the pollutants generation and attenuation using [this repo](https://github.com/icra/traca_contaminacio/tree/main))
- dades_effluent.py: get the discharge of domestic pollutants only (to be used for calibrating the pollutants generation and attenuation using [this repo](https://github.com/icra/traca_contaminacio/tree/main))

This repository is related with [pyswatplus](https://github.com/icra/pySWATPlus), our [modified version of SWAT for modeling point-source pollutants](https://github.com/icra/swatplus), and [the repository for doing the calibration](https://github.com/icra/traca_contaminacio)
